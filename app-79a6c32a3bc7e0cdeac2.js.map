mime type determination is not reliable across platforms. CSV files,\n * for example, are reported as text/plain under macOS but as application/vnd.ms-excel under\n * Windows. In some cases there might not be a mime type set at all.\n * See: https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone/issues/276\n * @param {boolean} [props.multiple=true] Allow drag 'n' drop (or selection from the file dialog) of multiple files\n * @param {boolean} [props.preventDropOnDocument=true] If false, allow dropped items to take over the current browser window\n * @param {boolean} [props.noClick=false] If true, disables click to open the native file selection dialog\n * @param {boolean} [props.noKeyboard=false] If true, disables SPACE/ENTER to open the native file selection dialog.\n * Note that it also stops tracking the focus state.\n * @param {boolean} [props.noDrag=false] If true, disables drag 'n' drop\n * @param {boolean} [props.noDragEventsBubbling=false] If true, stops drag event propagation to parents\n * @param {number} [props.minSize=0] Minimum file size (in bytes)\n * @param {number} [props.maxSize=Infinity] Maximum file size (in bytes)\n * @param {boolean} [props.disabled=false] Enable/disable the dropzone\n * @param {getFilesFromEvent} [props.getFilesFromEvent] Use this to provide a custom file aggregator\n * @param {Function} [props.onFileDialogCancel] Cb for when closing the file dialog with no selection\n * @param {dragCb} [props.onDragEnter] Cb for when the `dragenter` event occurs.\n * @param {dragCb} [props.onDragLeave] Cb for when the `dragleave` event occurs\n * @param {dragCb} [props.onDragOver] Cb for when the `dragover` event occurs\n * @param {dropCb} [props.onDrop] Cb for when the `drop` event occurs.\n * Note that this callback is invoked after the `getFilesFromEvent` callback is done.\n *\n * Files are accepted or rejected based on the `accept`, `multiple`, `minSize` and `maxSize` props.\n * `accept` must be a valid [MIME type](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) according to [input element specification](https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/input/file) or a valid file extension.\n * If `multiple` is set to false and additional files are dropped,\n * all files besides the first will be rejected.\n * Any file which does not have a size in the [`minSize`, `maxSize`] range, will be rejected as well.\n *\n * Note that the `onDrop` callback will always be invoked regardless if the dropped files were accepted or rejected.\n * If you'd like to react to a specific scenario, use the `onDropAccepted`/`onDropRejected` props.\n *\n * `onDrop` will provide you with an array of [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) objects which you can then process and send to a server.\n * For example, with [SuperAgent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) as a http/ajax library:\n *\n * ```js\n * function onDrop(acceptedFiles) {\n *   const req = request.post('/upload')\n *   acceptedFiles.forEach(file => {\n *     req.attach(file.name, file)\n *   })\n *   req.end(callback)\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {dropAcceptedCb} [props.onDropAccepted]\n * @param {dropRejectedCb} [props.onDropRejected]\n *\n * @returns {DropzoneState}\n */\n\nexport function useDropzone() {\n  var options = arguments.length > 0 && arguments[0] !== undefined ? arguments[0] : {};\n\n  var _defaultProps$options = _objectSpread(_objectSpread({}, defaultProps), options),\n      accept = _defaultProps$options.accept,\n      disabled = _defaultProps$options.disabled,\n      getFilesFromEvent = _defaultProps$options.getFilesFromEvent,\n      maxSize = _defaultProps$options.maxSize,\n      minSize = _defaultProps$options.minSize,\n      multiple = _defaultProps$options.multiple,\n      maxFiles = _defaultProps$options.maxFiles,\n      onDragEnter = _defaultProps$options.onDragEnter,\n      onDragLeave = _defaultProps$options.onDragLeave,\n      onDragOver = _defaultProps$options.onDragOver,\n      onDrop = _defaultProps$options.onDrop,\n      onDropAccepted = _defaultProps$options.onDropAccepted,\n      onDropRejected = _defaultProps$options.onDropRejected,\n      onFileDialogCancel = _defaultProps$options.onFileDialogCancel,\n      preventDropOnDocument = _defaultProps$options.preventDropOnDocument,\n      noClick = _defaultProps$options.noClick,\n      noKeyboard = _defaultProps$options.noKeyboard,\n      noDrag = _defaultProps$options.noDrag,\n      noDragEventsBubbling = _defaultProps$options.noDragEventsBubbling,\n      validator = _defaultProps$options.validator;\n\n  var rootRef = useRef(null);\n  var inputRef = useRef(null);\n\n  var _useReducer = useReducer(reducer, initialState),\n      _useReducer2 = _slicedToArray(_useReducer, 2),\n      state = _useReducer2[0],\n      dispatch = _useReducer2[1];\n\n  var isFocused = state.isFocused,\n      isFileDialogActive = state.isFileDialogActive,\n      draggedFiles = state.draggedFiles;
