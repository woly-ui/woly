`onCreateWebpackConfig`. The configuration sets the loader to handle its\n * own file, so if we import `./loaders/mdx-components`, the `mdx-components`\n * loader handles loading itself.\n *\n * # Why does this work?\n * The loader doesn't use the file argument to itself and instead returns\n * a generated file that includes the `gatsby-config` mdxPlugins wrapped in\n * require() statements. This results in the `mdxPlugins` being required\n * and available to the code after this import.\n *\n * # Have a better solution to this?\n * Submit a PR\n */\nimport { plugins as mdxPlugins } from \"./loaders/mdx-components\"\nimport scopeContexts from \"./loaders/mdx-scopes\"\n\nconst componentsAndGuards = {}\n\nconst componentFromGuards = arr =>\n  function GatsbyMDXComponentFinder(props) {\n    const { Component } = arr.find(({ guard }) => (guard ? guard(props) : true))\n    return <Component {...props} />\n  }\n\nmdxPlugins.forEach(({ guards = {}, components }) => {\n  Object.entries(components).forEach(([componentName, Component]) => {\n    if (componentsAndGuards[componentName]) {\n      componentsAndGuards.push({ guard: guards[componentName], Component })\n    } else {\n      componentsAndGuards[componentName] = [\n        { guard: guards[componentName], Component },\n      ]\n    }\n  })\n})\n\nconst components = Object.entries(componentsAndGuards)\n  .map(([name, arr]) => {\n    return {\n      [name]: componentFromGuards(\n        arr.concat({ guard: undefined, Component: name })\n      ),\n    }\n  })\n  .reduce((acc, obj) => {\n    return { ...acc, ...obj }\n  }, {})\n\n// merge any components in wrapRootElement above this wrapRoot\nconst MDXConsumer = withMDXComponents(\n  ({ components: componentsFromContext, children }) => (\n    <MDXScopeProvider __mdxScope={scopeContexts}>\n      <MDXProvider components={{ ...componentsFromContext, ...components }}>\n        {children}\n      </MDXProvider>\n    </MDXScopeProvider>\n  )\n)\n\nconst WrapRootElement = ({ element }) => <MDXConsumer>{element}</MDXConsumer>\n\nexport default WrapRootElement\n","import wrap from \"./wrap-root-element\"\nexport const wrapRootElement = wrap\n","module.exports = {plugins: []}","import invariant from \"invariant\"; ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// startsWith(string, search) - Check if `string` starts with `search`\n\nvar startsWith = function startsWith(string, search) {\n  return string.substr(0, search.length) === search;\n}; ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// pick(routes, uri)\n//\n// Ranks and picks the best route to match.
